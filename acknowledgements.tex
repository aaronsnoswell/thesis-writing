I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Surya Singh for his support, patience, encouragement and advice.
His vast engineering knowledge provided many an answer, and his sense of humor many a needed laugh.

I would like to thank my wife, Centaine for the sleepless hours spent staying up with me, encouraging me to \enquote*{just write one more section}.
For all the craziness you put up with I am truly indebted to you.
To my family also; Mum, Dad, Michelle, my brothers and Candy for the love and support.
Thanks especially to Elijah, for many interesting conversations and insights from a photographer's point of view.

Thanks is owed to Donald Dansereau from the University of Sydney for his excellent work on the Light Field Toolbox for Matlab.

Thanks to the other Mechatronics staff at UQ, especially Dr. Paul Pounds and Dr. Hanna Kurniawati for your input, and Prof. Ross McAree for the support.

Finally, to the Big G upstairs, thanks for getting me this far, I couldn't have done any of it without you.
