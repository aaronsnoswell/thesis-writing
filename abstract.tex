An equation describing a 3D Point Spread Function is derived, allowing depth-aware deconvolution to be performed on motion-blurred images.
Depth maps from the commercial Lytro light field camera are analysed and a piecewise linear mapping found that gives calibrated depth map measurements.
Several motion-blurred scenes are photographed using a Lytro camera and a means for applying depth-aware deconvolution to the light field images demonstrated.
Quantitative results show improved de-blurring performance compared to traditional 2D deconvolution methods.
