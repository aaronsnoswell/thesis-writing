This thesis discusses two key computer vision problems; the ability to de-blur a motion-blurred light field image, and the ability to use deconvolution de-blurring methods for images with large depth variation.
An equation describing a 3D Point Spread Function is derived, allowing depth-aware deconvolution to be performed on motion-blurred images.
Depth maps from the commercial Lytro light field camera are analysed and a piecewise linear mapping found that gives calibrated depth map measurements.
By combining these two results, a framework for deconvolution de-blurring of a light field image is described, and an experiment designed to verify a simplified test case.
Several motion-blurred scenes are photographed using a Lytro camera and a means for applying depth-aware deconvolution to light field images is demonstrated.
Quantitative results show improved de-blurring performance compared to traditional 2D deconvolution methods.
To our knowledge, this is the first documented application of deconvolution de-blurring to a motion-blurred light field image.
